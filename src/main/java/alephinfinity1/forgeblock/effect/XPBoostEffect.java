/*
 * Note: this is the vanilla XP boost effect. It does not affect skill XP.
 *
 * When debugging, keep note that there is a degree of randomness to this effect. E.g. gaining 5 XP through 
 * killing a mob (2 1-XP orbs, 1 3-XP orb) under XP Boost IV may give anywhere between 5â€“8 XP, as opposed to
 * the expected 6 XP. Expectancy value is still 6, though.
 * 
 * Also, don't expect a big change in XP gained. Even at Lvl 256, will still only give a +12800% boost. Enough
 * to bring up 75% of a level from a zombie, but not enough to reach Lv100 in one hit.
